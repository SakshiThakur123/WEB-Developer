   <p><strong>Hobby</strong> is Something that you do regularly for pleasure in your free time.</p>
   <p>My hobby is <strong>dancing</strong>, as it gives me joy and happiness.Dancing is not only about performing moves, but it is a way to express your emotions.Since my childhood days, I grasped the art of dancing.That's because dancing, like many physical activities, releases hormones known as endorphins. These chemicals are directly responsible for making you feel happy and relaxed.</p>
   <p> I dance because there's no greater feeling in the world than moving a piece of music and letting the rest of the world disappear.
    Some of my happiest moments have been dancing.

<p>My hobby is <strong>Listning music</strong>Imagine the world without a sound, without just a simple tap on a table, without the wind on the surface of the ocean pushing through the waters, and without a sound that a person can make to communicate. The world will be plain, will be simple, and though the earth is colorful, it will always remain blank and black. God is very amazing that He gifted us sound that adds to the beauty of every being. We often take it for granted as it became an ordinary part of our living. Thus, Music exists, and that alone is an essential reason why we have to live. </p>
